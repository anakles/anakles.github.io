# Creating a InfoSec Blog

I've noticed that I like teaching people what I've learned, but I was never really good at it. Something I've always found outstanding, was the sheer amount of helpful people and resources in the InfoSec community. 

I've been thinking about creating a personal blog for a while and just now followed these thoughts.

I want to help getting people into this field and spark discussion. At last, technology is always evolving. Those who stop learning, may be left behind.

**How to start?**

Just the intention to start this blog did not get me very far. The first problem I was confroned with was the choice on how to publish my thoughts to the world. 
After a little research I decided, that a static web page should be sufficient, since there are plattforms like Twitter and Mastodon, which I prefer for interaction.
Yet, hosting the website myself seemed like an unnecessary hassle. That's why I was very glad to figure out, that GitHub offeres a *GitHub Pages* site for every account.
This also comes with the benefit of a somewhat personalized domain name: `anakles.github.io`.

Very enthusiatically I dove into the world of *Jekyll*, the *Ruby* framework that is used to host GitHub pages. Only to be then overwhelmed. I have never been among the best programmers, but were always able to handle myself. But diving into a completely new language and framework, years after I have written my last line of code, was harder than I initially expected.

Fortunatly Jekyll makes this really easy. I've grabbed a nice looking, publicly available [template](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-serial-programmer) and changed everything I needed. I'm sure, as time goes on, I will change the look and feel even more. 

The rest is just writing my first article and push everything into my repository.

**More to come**

In the future, you can expect a lot more content from me.
I want to share 
-   News
-   HTB writeups
-   Current research projects
-   Great resources
and much more.
